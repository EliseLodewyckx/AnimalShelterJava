# Animal shelter in Java
This project is setUp to be able to redo the AnimalShelter redictions with Java. Dependencies for all libraries are added, but you probably just need one.
The goal of this is to do some research to these libraries. Therefore I added some questions to answer. Feel free to add your own questions. And try to document the answers here as well. 


## Working with Mahout
### Questions
1. When and why use Mahout?
2. Advantaged and disadvantages of using Mahout comparing to other libraries (including sklearn)
3. When implementing a model as similar as possible to our Tree model in Python, what are the differences in the performance of the model (precision - recall - f1 score - accuracy)

### Answers
### General findings 
### Things I like to explore further
